# Agent Camp

Introduction to decentralized AI agents development.

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Agent Camp Bootcamp**. This repository houses all the necessary instructions and resources for an immersive 6-days program designed to equip students with cutting-edge techniques for developing applications using **Generative Artificial Intelligence** for **Decentralized AI Agents**.

Our bootcamp emphasizes a **hands-on** and **project-based** approach, allowing students to learn concepts and immediately apply them to real-world challenges. While we don't dive into the depths of AI or Web3 research itself, our focus is on the **practical applications** of these technologies for building **Decentralized AI Agents**.

Throughout this program, students will gain proficiency with the latest AI tools and technologies for building Decentralized AI Agents with industry best practices from experts in the AI and Web3 fields.

Upon successful completion of the bootcamp, participants will have acquired:

- A comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art Generative AI models and tools
- Expertise in AI techniques for image and text recognition and generation
- Familiarity with industry best practices and advanced techniques in AI application development
- The capability to independently develop projects incorporating AI and Web3 features

## Curriculum

Our bootcamp is structured as follows:

- **Five sequential days** of intensive, hands-on lessons (Monday to Friday) complemented by exercises and group activities
- **One extra day for project demonstration** at the end of the bootcamp for participants to showcase their projects built during the week
- Follow up events with specific workshops and directions to participate in hackathons and/or getting a job in the AI and Web3 industries

### Schedule

- Day 1: Introduction to AI development
- Day 2: Build your first AI application
- Day 3: Deep dive into LLM architecture
- Day 4: Coding decentralized AI agents
- Day 5: Decentralized AI workshops
- Day 6: Project Demonstration

## Bootcamp Material

All bootcamp materials are accessible within this repository. The content is organized into folders, with each folder representing a day's lesson. These folders contain one `README.md` file each with comprehensive lesson materials, including hands-on exercises, implementation examples, detailed instructions, and step-by-step guides to follow during the lesson.

## Hands-on Lessons

To maximize learning, students should prepare their own development environment to actively participate in the lessons. Each day, they will learn by replicating the instructor's steps and applying newly acquired concepts to real-world projects.

Students are encouraged to ask questions and seek assistance from instructors and mentors during the lessons. Additional support is available through the use of Github Issues inside this repository.

> If you have any questions, you can open a Github Issue in this repository following some [Q&A template](https://github.com/devspace/awesome-github-templates) that you find better for solving your issue. An instructor will answer your question as soon as possible, and you can also help other students by answering their questions in this same repository.

We strongly encourage students to collaborate on group projects, share discoveries, learn from peers, and assist one another in completing project challenges.

## Support

For any questions or assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to the instructors and fellow students in our [Telegram Group](https://dabl.chat).
